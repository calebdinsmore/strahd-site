# Quest Log

This page is home to the log of different quests the party has uncovered or created. I (the DM) don't write anything here: this is a place where players can pool their collective knowledge or quest lines together.

> [!help] How do I contribute?
> Since it's not possible for me to add collaborators to this page/site, I've created a [Google Doc](https://jstrieb.github.io/link-lock/#eyJ2IjoiMC4wLjEiLCJlIjoiSmhRcU9jVXVaZVpnUzI5dUNGTnhGSEZNN0N1b3E3M09BeFRKY0dRMjdaSlBxUVRRaFIrSUJERGh2dWdpQ1poeFlkR2tBLy9CYzU3L2hZRDJRZ3pKZ2xtckxqN1QyeHdlME1rMkU3c29CT096ZkhORVFvaW82d09NdGZPTGtvT2FudFgvbHFxZTE1K0RFNFdYdFBZLytRPT0iLCJzIjoiQlRJMzFjKzFZMVYxaWVtejV4UkFzUT09IiwiaSI6IkNQN3BIVkhTcEZrUHh2STAifQ==) that players can write in. I'll periodically pull that information into this page.

## Gregor Stanovich and the Missing People

We got hired to find Gregor Stanovich, who went missing a couple of days ago–the latest in a series of mysterious disappearances.
- We visited Gregor’s Home and found a bloody candlestick & a pendant w/ a rising sun
- In discussions we found out that it is a pendant of the Morninglord
- We went to the church of the Morninglord. Talked to the priest Donavich who is lying through his teeth
- Through a trapdoor we get into the basement and meet Donavich's son Doru, who is a “Spawn of Strahd”
- The priest fed people to his son-monster and asked us not to hurt him.
- We OBVIOUSLY killed the monster.

## Mad Mary

- We heard of a woman called Mad Mary who laments all day long.
- Her Daughter Gertruda was taken by Strahd a week ago

## Morgana

- Weird woman selling cakes that are hallucinogenic.
- After not being paid by a poor guy she took his son. 
- We tried to stop her, but failed.
- She fled with (too fast for her age) steps to a windmill (northwest of town, near a Vistani encampment)
