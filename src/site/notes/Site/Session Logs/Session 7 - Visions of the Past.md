# Session 7: Visions of the Past

The adventurers, having narrowly escaped the child-snatching hags of the old windmill, took refuge in a small clearing off the Old Svalich Road. With them were their new companions, the Vallakian guards Vasily and Mana, and Ireena Kolyana. The night was far from over, as the party's focus turned to the mysterious, leather-bound tome they had retrieved from the windmill's attic.

## The Tome of Strahd

As Gowain opened the book, the air grew cold. The first page, scribbled in a strange shorthand, magically transformed into Common script before his eyes:

_"I, Strahd, Lord of Barovia... hereby set down an exact record of those events, that the truth may at last be known."_

Mist poured from the book's binding, and the party was pulled into a vision. They found themselves in a sunlit castle courtyard, witnessing a past moment. A young boy, no older than twelve, sat dejectedly on a set of stairs, a practice sword at his side. He introduced himself as Strahd von Zarovich, future king of the castle. Through a nearby door, the party overheard a conversation between Strahd's father, King Barov, and a stern dusk elf adviser—the very same elf they had seen at the burgomaster's funeral in the Village of Barovia. They debated young Strahd's readiness to rule, with his father expressing confidence and the adviser, Rahadin, voicing harsh doubts.

The vision faded, and the party found themselves back at their campfire. The book had attuned itself to them, revealing itself as the **Tome of Strahd**. It granted them magical protection against Strahd himself and held the promise of revealing more of his secrets through further study.

## The Wolves of the Svalich Road

The next morning, the party set out for Vallaki. Their familiars, a raven and a cat, scouted the path ahead. As they descended into a wooded valley, the woods suddenly came alive. A massive pack of wolves and dire wolves burst from the trees, ambushing the travelers.

A desperate battle erupted on the road.

- Getafix, revealing a startling new power, transformed into a symbiotic entity, his body glowing with green necrotic energy as a purple mushroom sprouted from his forehead.
- Lorian’s crossbow bolts flew with deadly precision, felling one dire wolf after another.
- Gowain unleashed the divine power of his holy symbol, bathing the battlefield in a flash of light—the _Radiance of the Dawn_—which vaporized two wolves instantly.

Despite their power, the ambush took its toll. Mana was viciously mauled by a dire wolf and fell, bleeding out on the dirt road. With the last of the wolves defeated, Gowain rushed to her side, his healing magic knitting her torn throat back together and pulling her from the brink of death.

## A Somber Discovery

Remembering their mission, Vasily and Mana asked the party to help them find the missing herbalist, Elira. Getafix, calling upon his druidic knowledge, tracked the wolves' path back to their den. There, amidst the grim remains of other prey, they found the ravaged corpse of the woman. Mana wordlessly picked up the body, and the somber group continued their journey to Vallaki to give her a proper burial.

## The Uncanny Town of Vallaki

As dusk approached, the party arrived at the town of Vallaki. It was a stark contrast to the desolate, fearful village they had left behind. Surrounded by a high wooden palisade, the town within was bustling and almost cheerful. Children played in the streets, a busker played a tune, and colorful posters advertised an upcoming "Festival of the Blazing Sun." The forced joviality felt uncanny, a thin veneer of normalcy stretched over Barovia's ever-present gloom. For Ireena, it was a glimpse of a freedom she hadn't known since she was a child.

After being admitted by the guards, the party made their way to **St. Andral's Church**. They were met by Father Lucian, a kind but weary priest who agreed to give Elira her final rites. He spoke of the church as the safest place in all of Barovia, cryptically mentioning an ancient ritual that protected it from "the devil." Intrigued, Gowain cast a spell to detect magic and was nearly blinded by an overwhelming aura of abjuration magic that enveloped the entire church grounds. With the burial complete, Vasily and Mana gave their heartfelt thanks and departed, leaving the party to find lodging for the night.

## Rumors and Ravens at the Blue Water Inn

The heroes found their way to the **Blue Water Inn**, a large, lively tavern with ravens perched along its roof. The establishment was run by Danica Martikov, who seemed to take a particular interest in Gowain. When questioned, she deflected, blaming his "hostility" towards the ravens, whom she considered friends of the inn.

While Getafix and Gowain retired to their room to begin the laborious four-hour process of deciphering the next chapter of the Tome, Lorian and Kellen mingled with the locals. They spoke with two gruff hunters, Joldar and Evgeni, and a well-dressed accountant named **Vasili von Holtz**. From them, they gathered crucial intelligence about the town's tense political climate:

- **Baron Vargas Vallakovich**, the burgomaster, enforces a strict policy of mandatory happiness, holding weekly festivals to keep morale high, believing it keeps the town safe. Any dissent is publicly punished in the town stocks.
- **Lady Fiona Wachter**, a rival noble, openly despises the Baron and is rumored to have ancient family ties to Strahd himself.
- The accountant, Vasili, explained that the young guard they had traveled with had taken his name in admiration after he had helped him out of a past trouble.

Their inquiries about a set of "amber doors" from their Tarokka reading yielded no results.

## The Warrior God

As the night wore on, Getafix and Gowain completed their work. The Tome of Strahd flared to life once more, pulling the entire party into a second vision. They stood in a war tent, face to face with a younger, vital Strahd, clad in scarlet armor. He was no prince, but a general, planning a battle against the knights of the Order of the Silver Dragon at their fortress, **Castle Argynvost**.

The scene shifted, and the party found themselves on the battlefield, cast as soldiers in Strahd's army. As the assault began, Strahd was struck by a javelin and knocked from his horse. The party chose to press the attack, following a commander named Alexandra up the steep path to the castle. As they charged, massive boulders were sent rolling down the hill, and they were forced to scramble up the treacherous slope to avoid being crushed.

Upon reaching the top, they were met by a formidable general of the Order of the Silver Dragon, wielding a magnificent sword with a hilt like silver dragon wings. As he and his guards turned to face them, the session ended, leaving the heroes on the verge of a battle in Strahd's distant past.
