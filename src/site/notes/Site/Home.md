# Previously, on The Barovian Boom Boys...

- Lured into the mysterious, fog-shrouded land of Barovia, the party survived the horrors of the cursed **Durst Manor**. Inside, they unraveled the grim fate of the Durst family, who had turned to cannibalism in service to a "dread lord" named **Strahd von Zarovich**, and laid the spirits of the murdered Durst children to rest.
- Emerging into the desolate Village of Barovia, they encountered a sinister pastry-seller trading her wares for local children and met **Ismark Kolyanovich**, who pleaded for help protecting his sister, **Ireena**.
- Their investigations led them to the local church, where they discovered the priest, Donavich, had been feeding villagers to his vampire spawn son, **Doru**. After vanquishing the creature, they blackmailed the priest into their service. They also cleansed the town's poisoned well after it caused a small zombie outbreak, aided by a mule named Hans.
- The party agreed to help Ismark with his father's burial. The funeral was dramatically interrupted by the arrival of Strahd himself. When a grief-stricken Ismark charged the vampire lord, the party intervened, preventing his certain death before battling a horde of zombies summoned by Strahd.
- Convinced of the party's strength, Ismark persuaded them to escort Ireena to the fortified town of Vallaki. As payment, he gifted them the magical **Ring of the Watcher**.
- The journey was marked by unsettling omens. Their path led them to a Vistani encampment, where they were granted an audience with the enigmatic fortune teller, **Madam Eva**. Her Tarokka card reading provided them with five cryptic clues hinting at the locations of powerful artifacts and a potential ally.
- Setting out toward Vallaki, the party was intercepted by two guards—**Vasily**, a nervous trapper, and **Mana**, a broad-shouldered volunteer—searching for a missing herbalist from Vallaki. The guards agreed to join the group on the journey.
- The party made a crucial detour to an ancient **windmill on a precipice**, one of the locations mentioned in Madam Eva's prophecy. There, they discovered the dark truth behind the missing children of Barovia: the windmill's proprietors, **Bella** and **Ofelia**, had been kidnapping children and keeping them imprisoned in crates on the upper floors. Among the captives were **Freek** (the boy from the Village of Barovia) and a young girl named **Myrtle**. The party recovered a mysterious cipher-bound tome that appeared to belong to Strahd himself, though they were forced to retreat before rescuing the children.
- After escaping the windmill, the party opened the mysterious tome, revealing it to be the **Tome of Strahd**. They were pulled into a vision of Strahd's childhood, witnessing his father, King Barov, and his stern advisor, Rahadin.
- The next day, their journey to Vallaki was ambushed by a massive pack of wolves. The guard, Mana, was gravely injured but saved by Gowain's healing magic. They later found the body of the missing herbalist they had been searching for.
- Arriving in the unsettlingly cheerful town of **Vallaki**, they arranged for a proper burial at **St. Andral's Church** and met the priest, **Father Lucian**.
- At the **Blue Water Inn**, they gathered rumors about the town's tyrannical Burgomaster, **Baron Vargas Vallakovich**, and his rival, **Lady Fiona Wachter**. Further study of the Tome plunged them into a second vision, casting them as soldiers in General Strahd's army during an ancient assault on **Castle Argynvost**.
- **Where we left off:** The party finds themselves on a historical battlefield, facing a general of the Order of the Silver Dragon, caught in a vision of Strahd's war-torn past. The safety of Vallaki is a temporary respite as the secrets of Barovia's history unfold around them.
