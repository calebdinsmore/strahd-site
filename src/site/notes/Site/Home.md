# Previously, on The Barovian Boom Boys...

- Lured into a mysterious, fog-shrouded land, the party found themselves before a strange, sentient house. Inside, they discovered it was the cursed home of the Durst family, who had delved into dark rituals of cannibalism in service to a "dread lord" named **Strahd von Zarovich**.
- Haunted by the spirits of the murdered Durst children, Rose and Thorn, the adventurers battled their way through the residence, laying the children's spirits to rest in their family crypt. They fought their way out of the collapsing house, escaping with their lives but losing their newly-found canine companion, Sophaxis.
- Emerging into the desolate Village of Barovia, they encountered a sinister pastry-seller named Morgana who was trading her magically-infused wares for local children.
- At the Blood of the Vine tavern, they met **Ismark Kolyanovich**, who pleaded with them to help protect his sister, **Ireena**, from the unwanted advances of Strahd and to see that their deceased father, the Burgomaster, received a proper burial.
- Investigating the local church, the party discovered the priest, Donavich, had been feeding villagers to his vampire spawn son, Doru, whom he kept locked in the undercroft. After a brutal battle, the party vanquished the creature.
- Rather than deliver justice, the party chose to blackmail the complicit priest, binding him to their service with the promise of secrecy. They concocted a cover story for Ismark to protect their new asset.
- A new crisis arose as a villager fell sick and rose as a zombie, leading the party to discover the town well had been poisoned. Their investigation, which included interrogating a mule named Hans, confirmed the water was corrupted.
- Descending into the well, the party dispatched five zombies shambling in the cistern below. They hoisted the bodies out and magically purified the town's only source of fresh water.
- **Where we left off:** With the immediate threats of Doru and the poisoned well neutralized, the party must now decide how to proceed. The most pressing issues they might consider addressing are Ismark's requests to assist with his father's funeral and eventually escort Ireena to Vallaki.
