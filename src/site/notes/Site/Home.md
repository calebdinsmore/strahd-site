# Previously, on The Barovian Boom Boys...

- Lured into the mysterious, fog-shrouded land of Barovia, the party survived the horrors of the cursed **Durst Manor**. Inside, they unraveled the grim fate of the Durst family, who had turned to cannibalism in service to a "dread lord" named **Strahd von Zarovich**, and laid the spirits of the murdered Durst children to rest.
- Emerging into the desolate Village of Barovia, they encountered a sinister pastry-seller trading her wares for local children and met **Ismark Kolyanovich**, who pleaded for help protecting his sister, **Ireena**.
- Their investigations led them to the local church, where they discovered the priest, Donavich, had been feeding villagers to his vampire spawn son, **Doru**. After vanquishing the creature, they blackmailed the priest into their service. They also cleansed the town's poisoned well after it caused a small zombie outbreak, aided by a mule named Hans.
- The party agreed to help Ismark with his father's burial. The funeral was dramatically interrupted by the arrival of Strahd himself. When a grief-stricken Ismark charged the vampire lord, the party intervened, preventing his certain death before battling a horde of zombies summoned by Strahd.
- Convinced of the party's strength, Ismark persuaded them to escort Ireena to the fortified town of Vallaki. As payment, he gifted them the magical **Ring of the Watcher**.
- The journey was marked by unsettling omens. Their path led them to a Vistani encampment, where they were granted an audience with the enigmatic fortune teller, **Madam Eva**. Her Tarokka card reading provided them with five cryptic clues hinting at the locations of powerful artifacts and a potential ally.
- **Where we left off:** Armed with five cryptic prophecies from Madam Eva's reading, the adventurers, now level four, must decipher these clues and continue their journey to Vallaki, all while protecting Ireena from the ever-present shadow of Strahd.
