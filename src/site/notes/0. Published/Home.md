# Previously, on The Barovian Boom Boys

- The party mysteriously found themselves transported to a dark, fog-shrouded land, eventually being sealed inside by a pair of massive iron gates.
- They encountered the ghostly forms of two children, Rose and Thorn, who tricked them into entering their family home to rescue their "baby brother" from a "monster in the basement."
- Inside the house, they discovered the grim history of the Durst family, who were part of a degenerate cult attempting to win the favor of their "dread lord," Strahd von Zarovich in one of their apparent bids to gain immortality.
- The house itself was a supernatural trap, shifting between a pristine illusion and a decayed ruin. The party battled animated armor and the vengeful specter of the children's nursemaid.
- They learned Rose and Thorn were locked in the attic by their parents, where they eventually died. The desperate spirits possessed two party members, refusing to be left alone once more.
- Beneath the house, they navigated a dungeon, fighting ghouls, a carrion crawler, and shadow creatures.
- In the family crypt, the party laid the children's skeletons to rest, freeing the possessed heroes and giving the spirits peace.
- Their descent ended in a sacrificial chamber where they refused to offer a sacrifice, causing the "heart of the house"—a fleshy, monstrous amalgam of Elizabeth Durst—to attack.
- After destroying the monster, the party made a frantic escape from the collapsing house before it became their tomb.
- **Where we left off:** The exhausted, now level 3, party stands outside the ruined manor. The mists have cleared, revealing the Village of Barovia before them. Their rescued dog, Sophaxis, has just crumbled to dust in a final, cruel twist of the knife from the house they left behind.
